# naumer\_ICML\_2022

## Overview
The repository [naumer\_ICML\_2022](https://github.com/helmuthn/naumer_ICML_2022.jl) contains code related to my anticipated ICML submission in 2022.

The code is split into two main sections.
The folder `src` represents a library which represents the main building blocks of the work and could be applied to other problems.
The folder `PlotGeneration` contains the scripts to reproduce the plots in the manuscript.

This library is not registered through the Julia package registry, but the package manager can still install it through: 
    ] add https://github.com/helmuthn/naumer_ICML_2022.jl

For now, below is a list of functions and docstrings.
The documentation will be filled out more after the manuscript is complete.
